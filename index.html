          <li>Git Notes</li>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>Git — a tool that allows developers and others to use version control. Fixes the problem – multiple copies of a document floating around/edits from multiple people – Git is version control. Multiple parties edits can be tracked in one place and you can jump around to find bugs or edit. </li>
          <li>Commit: Saves – but records and able to show what changes were made. Smarter saving. Github tracks how many file changes additions/deletions. No limit on commits.</li>
          <li>Commits have “parents”: the version that existed before saving.</li>
         <li> Branches: where you work inside a repo – sandbox for everyone to work on project and prepare contributions without affecting live project. </li>
          <li>Forks: exactly like a branch, but from someone else’s org. You can fork a copy of someone elses repository into your org. You have the ability to makes changes – then send the change back to the original org for review. </li>
          <li> Pull request: it’s a request for main branch to pull the commits you made, into their main branch. <br>
          You made changes – you request for them to be reviewed and eventually published with main site after further possible changes are made – by request of reviewers.
